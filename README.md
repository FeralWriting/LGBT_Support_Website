# LGBT_Support_Website

A project I participated on along with two other people, Vanessa Fenin and Deborah Camacho. We created a website with the goal of assisting LGBTQ+ youths and providing resources to those who would also like to get involved. Website can be found here: https://lgbtq-website.glitch.me/.
