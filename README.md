# Voices Unsilenced - LGBT+ Support Website

A project I participated on along with two other people, Vanessa Fenin and Deborah Camacho, called Voices Unsilenced. We created a website with the goal of assisting LGBTQ+ youths and providing resources to those who would also like to get involved. It provides important information on voting, current and historical events/issues, and emergency assistance. The site consists of four pages, a home page, a resources page, a get help page, and an about us page. This project incorporated Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This project gave me experience with cooperation, remote group work, web developement, web design, debugging, checklists, and the parallax scrolling effect. The website can be found here: https://lgbtq-website.glitch.me/.

## Features:

### Header

Each page contains the same header which links to all four pages. On the left is the home page, and the right contains the three other pages.

### Home Page

The home page contains the header and the title of the website, Voices Unsilenced, along with a checklist at the top of the page. The checklist walks the user through steps to be able to vote. Scrolling down the page will introduce the user to the parallax effect with some interesting graphics in the background. There are links to the "resources" and "get help" page.

### Resources Page

The resources page provides information to users about problems the community is facing, ways to help solve those problems, and how to get the ability to vote. it also contains a header and footer. The footer provides other ways to get active and educated, including places to donate to and literature to read.

### Get Help Page

The get help page contains a header and resources to use if LGBT+ individuals are in need of assistance. It provides information about shelters, mental health issues, and parental issues.

### About Us Page

The about us page contains a header and short descriptions of the developers of this project.
